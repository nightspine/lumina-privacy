  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 25, 2026</p>

  <p>Lumina ("the App") is an EPUB reader application. This policy explains what information the App collects, how it is used, and your rights regarding that information.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <h3>Information you provide</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>EPUB files</strong> you import are stored locally on your device and, if you enable cloud sync, in your personal Appwrite cloud storage.</li>
    <li><strong>Account credentials</strong> (email address and password) if you choose to create an account for cloud sync. Passwords are hashed and never stored in plain text.</li>
    <li><strong>AI provider API keys</strong> you enter (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) are stored locally on your device and synced to your personal cloud account if you are signed in. They are never transmitted to Lumina's servers.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Information collected automatically</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Reading progress and statistics</strong> (pages read, reading duration, session timestamps) are stored locally on your device. If cloud sync is enabled, this data is synced to your personal cloud storage account.</li>
    <li><strong>Highlights and bookmarks</strong> you create are stored locally and synced to your cloud account if enabled.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide the core reading experience: rendering EPUB content, tracking your position, and displaying statistics.</li>
    <li>To sync your library and progress across your devices when you opt in to cloud sync.</li>
    <li>To power AI features (X-ray entity extraction, chat, reading recap) by sending selected book text to the AI provider you configure. We do not send your book content to Lumina's own servers.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, share, or monetise your personal data.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use your data for advertising.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App may interact with the following third-party services <em>at your explicit direction</em>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Appwrite</strong> (cloud sync, authentication) — data is stored in your own project instance.</li>
    <li><strong>AI providers</strong> (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama, or OpenAI-compatible endpoints) — text you send for AI features is governed by the respective provider's privacy policy.</li>
    <li><strong>KOReader KOSync</strong> and <strong>Booklore</strong> — progress sync with servers you configure.</li>
    <li><strong>OPDS catalogs</strong> — public or self-hosted catalogs you add.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All local data (books, database, settings) is stored in the App's sandboxed container on your device.</li>
    <li>Cloud sync uses TLS encryption in transit.</li>
    <li>We do not have access to your Appwrite instance or the data stored within it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>You can delete all local data by uninstalling the App. Cloud data can be deleted from within the App (Account screen) or directly from your Appwrite project dashboard. Deleting your account removes all associated cloud data.</p>

  <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top of this page reflects when changes were made. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this policy, please open an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/nightspine/lumina">GitHub repository</a> or contact the developer through GitHub.</p>
